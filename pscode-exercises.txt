// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

BEGIN
NUMBER S1, S2, SUM
OUTPUT ("Input number1:")
INPUT s1
OUTPUT ("Input number2:")
INPUT s2
SUM=s1+s2
OUTPUT sum

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

BEGIN
DISPLAY "Enter Your Number - "
READ number
IF number / 2
PRINT "Number Is Even!"
ELSE
PRINT "Number Is Odd!"
END

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

BEGIN
NUMBER S1, S2, S3, S4, S5
OUTPUT ("Input number1:")
INPUT s1
OUTPUT ("Input number2:")
INPUT s2
OUTPUT ("Input number3:")
INPUT s3
OUTPUT ("Input number4:")
INPUT s4
OUTPUT ("Input number5:")
INPUT s5

SUM = S1+S2+S3+S4+S5
AVERAGE = Sum/5

MIN = s1

Is s2 < Min ? 
  Yes: Min = s2 
   No: Min is unchanged

Is s3 < Min ? 
  Yes: Min = s3 
   No: Min is unchanged

Is s4 < Min ? 
  Yes: Min = s4
   No: Min is unchanged

Is s5 < Min ? 
  Yes: Min = s5
   No: Min is unchanged

MAX = s1

Is s2 < Max ? 
  Yes: Max = s2 
   No: Max is unchanged

Is s3 < Max ? 
  Yes: Max = s3 
   No: Max is unchanged

Is s4 < Max ? 
  Yes: Max = s4
   No: Max is unchanged

Is s5 < Max ? 
  Yes: Max = s5
   No: Max is unchanged

OUTPUT "The mean value of these 5 numbers is "Average". "

OUTPUT "The minimum value of these 5 numbers is "Min". "

OUTPUT "The maximum value of these 5 numbers is "Max". "
